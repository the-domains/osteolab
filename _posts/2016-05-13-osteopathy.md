This is a manual therapy practice for all musculoskeletal conditions . We treat muscles, joints and the connective tissue that binds these all together. 

Our aim is to give the body the best chance of healing itself. We achieve this by promoting joint motion, circulation, strength training, improving proprioception and education about your condition and how the body works in relation to this. 

Osteopathy addresses the body as a whole unit. While treating a particular injury, we look to identify factors that have contributed to the injury. Additionally, we address the secondary mechanical consequences the injury then causes to the rest of the body. For this reason, treatment will often involve muscles and joints distant to the painful region. The relation between the injury and the rest of the body can take many forms, including; biomechanical or structural associations and neurological or circulatory relationships.
