Personal training services are used to complement your training program to assist you in achieving your health goals. Some benefits of having a personal trainer include:

* Effective training
* Safety and Risk minimisation 
* Guidance and support
* Direction so that you can focus on your exercises without worrying about what to do next
* Training programs made specifically for your goals

Exercises will be selected as appropriate for your health goals and allowing for any pre-existing injuries. Some exercises can aggravate particular injuries while some can help your recovery; not all exercises are created equally. It is often difficult to know which is which. Having a trainer with experience can lead you to the optimal program more quickly and with less set-backs. 

All sports and fitness pursuits carry the risk of injuries. Personal training will help to minimise your risk of injury and teach you how to approach your future training safely as you learn to be your own trainer.
